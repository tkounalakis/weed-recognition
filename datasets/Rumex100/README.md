#Rumex 100 Dataset weed recognition dataset

The dataset is compiled from 100 images depicting
the Broad-leaved dock (Rumex obtusifolius L.). Broad-leaved
dock is a very common weed found throughout Europe, North
America and Oceania. This type of weed is harmful both in
crops and dairy farming.

Images consisting the proposed dataset are taken from
multiple angles, with most of them being captured from a top-
view. All pictures were captured outdoors using
a high-resolution camera, under various natural illumination
conditions

The dataset is available in two versions. The first includes 100
images depicting the Broad-leaved dock plant in its surround-
ing environment.

The second version includes 900 images. It has resulted from the same
initial images, processed using an annotation tool. The annotation divided each
image in 9 equal regions. As a result, each one of the new smaller images
may either depict the weed plant or just its surrounding environment.
Each one of the 900 images have been manually labeled in those classes.
This format can be used for weed recognition
(and detection, if you reconstruct the images after recognition).

This dataset was introduced and used for the experimental evaluation of:
